        <h2 class="mt-5">About this site</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This site <b>does not use cookies.</b></li>
            <li>The server is hosted at <a href="https://contabo.com/en/">Contabo</a> in Germany.</li>
            <li>The server serving these (static) html pages does log client IP addresses and timestamps along with the
                accessed pages and the user-agent string sent by your browser and stores for one month. (access-log)
            </li>
            <li>The logs will be used to help eliminate site operational issues (diagnostics) or to detect security
                threats
                in
                case of an incident.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5">About our Applications in General</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We strive to make our apps safe and secure to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                We strive not to store any personal or sensitive data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Browser Extensions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The tools provided by KiGN run in your browser.</li>
            <li>During the natural interaction with your Atlassian applications, you might process and send data to your
                Atlassian suite with the help of the Atlassian web UI. These extensions do not really change that,
                but might make your workflows more efficient by augmenting the sent data.
            </li>
            <li>The tools might store data (settings) within your browser if you explicitly press the save button in
                your
                extension settings.*
            </li>
            <li>Even those settings usually do not contain personal data. One notable exception we can think of is, if
                you use your personal name as your domain name, and enter it in settings where applicable.
            </li>
        </ul>

            other
            browser and extension setting you set up to be synchronized.</i>
